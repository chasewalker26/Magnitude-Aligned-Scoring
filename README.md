## Datasets
Place the ImageNet and RESISC45 datasets in the project root folder.

## How to Use the Magnitude Aligned Scoring (MAS) Metric on Attributions
See `example.ipynb` for a full example of the application of the MAS source code for multiple attributions.

It shows:
<ul>
  <li>Importing and setting up models and images for prediction.</li>
  <li>Generating attributions using integrated gradients, left integrated gradients, gradcam, guided gradcam, guided backpropagation, guided integrated gradients, and adversarial gradient integration.</li>
  <li>The class initialization and wrapper functions needed to use MAS and how to run MAS on any of the above attributions.</li>
  <li>PIC and RISE are included for comparison.</li>
</ul>

## Replicating the Paper Experiments
To replicate the paper experiments, please see the README inside of the `MAS/experiments` folder.

All experimental data reported in the paper was generated by these tests and the commands in the README.

The test results are visible in `MAS/test_results`, `MAS/noise_ignorance`, and `MAS/sensitivity_test_grapher.ipynb`.
